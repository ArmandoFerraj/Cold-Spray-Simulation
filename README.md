# Cold-Spray-Simulation

Cold spray is the process of depositing fine metal powder onto a substrate by accelerating the particles with a supersonic gas stream. Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) utlizes this technology to build up layers of metal powder, creating a three-dimensional object layer by layer. In this project we can create a CSAM simulation by assuming the powder deposition follows a bivariate gaussian distribution, which is what we empirically see in practice.

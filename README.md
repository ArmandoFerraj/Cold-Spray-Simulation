# Cold-Spray-Simulation

Cold spray is the process of depositing metal powder onto a substrate by accelerating the particles with a supersonic gas stream. Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) utlizes this technology to create a three-dimensional object layer by layer. In this project we wil create a CSAM simulation using Matplotlib and SciPy.

- main.py is the actual program
- CS_simulation.ipynb provides the intuition and assumptions needed for the simulation

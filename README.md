# Cold-Spray-Simulation

Cold spray is the process of depositing metal powder onto a substrate by accelerating the particles with a supersonic gas stream. Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) utlizes this technology to create a three-dimensional object by building up layers of metal powder. In this project we can create a CSAM simulation by assuming the powder deposition follows a bivariate gaussian distribution.
